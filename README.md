# ðŸŒŽ Hello world!

My name is Andrezza

I graduated in International Relations mostly because of my love of foreign languages and my desire to troubleshoot conflicts to make the world a better place. Now I'm learning new kinds of languages â€“ programming languages. Soon I hope to be troubleshooting other types of conflicts â€“ version conflicts â€“ here on GitHub as well. Wish me luck!
